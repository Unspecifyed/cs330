The controls for camera movement are facilitated by the keys W, A, S, D for movement, and Q, E for yaw and pitch adjustments of the camera.

Despite encountering challenges in comprehending the tutorials, I endeavored to create this project from scratch. The project encompasses various components, including the development of vertex and fragment shader source codes, compilation, and linkageâ€”yielding a display that, while resembling a rainbow, showcases these fundamental aspects. Additionally, it involves the creation of matrices for a hollow cube, initialization processes, the establishment of a GLEW window, as well as the implementation of textures from PNGs through the integration of STB image headers, thoughtfully included in the project.

Furthermore, the project encompasses the generation of model-view and projection matrices, obtaining uniform locations from the shader program, and subsequently passing these crucial elements to the shader program itself. Notably, it involves the meticulous setup of buffers for each object, encompassing the generation of VAOs, acquisition of VBO and EBO IDs, binding processes, and the assignment of position attributes, colors, and textures to these buffers.

While navigating through the render loop, the project entails the transformation of the view matrix, incorporating hotkeys for camera movement, and ultimately rendering the hollow cube. I would like to acknowledge that this project presented considerable complexity, consuming a significant amount of time relative to other classes I have undertaken thus far.

My primary objective is to successfully complete this course, and I believe that this project adequately demonstrates my comprehension and utilization of OpenGL concepts. I am aware that each student may have varying levels of proficiency, and I am committed to enhancing my understanding further.

I appreciate your guidance and would be grateful for any feedback or guidance you may offer to help me improve in this area. Thank you for your time and consideration.
